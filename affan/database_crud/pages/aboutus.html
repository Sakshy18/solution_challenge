        We are a bunch of university students who believe everyone has a right to education and are willing to do our best for the same.
        <br>
        Hence we have come up with an idea of reselling books platform that allows the user to resell them,
        he/she can chat with the buyers and sell them accordingly.
        User will be able to buy second-hand books at a reasonable price and hence everyone will be able to access knowledge in a budget friendly way.
        Hence implementing <b>'Education to all'</b>.
